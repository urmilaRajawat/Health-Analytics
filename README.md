## Problem Statement

Health Analytics for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

Background:
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions). Understanding the patterns and factors associated with OCD can help improve diagnosis, treatment, and support for affected individuals.

Objective:
Develop a comprehensive health analytics solution to analyze data related to OCD patients and gain insights into the following aspects:

Obsession and Compulsion Types: Analyze the types and frequency of obsessions and compulsions reported by patients.

Ethnicity Analysis: Explore the distribution of OCD patients across different ethnic groups and identify any patterns or disparities.

Symptom Severity: Investigate the severity of OCD symptoms, such as obsession scores, and their impact on patients.

Demographic Factors: Investigate the influence of demographic factors (gender, ethnicity etc.) on OCD prevalence and symptom severity.
